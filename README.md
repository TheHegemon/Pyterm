# Pyterm
This program exists to generate two-word code phrases.

Why?  For fun.  Maybe you just want to see silly combinations, maybe you want a codename for 
some project that you're working on.  Either way, this should do the trick. 

Run the program by running the python script.  You can also call the script as a function to 
specify the number of output phrases.
